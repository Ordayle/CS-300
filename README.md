# CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    
    This course delt with different data models (Binary trees, Hash Tables, Linked Lists) and their appropriate 
    usage within applications.     
    
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    
    I tried to understand the relatove strengths and weakness of each data structure and apply them when their 
    strengths poutweighted their weaknesses.
    
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

    I overcame any issues by researching the offical documentation of the method, or looking for example uses. Or, sometimes, 
    I made a small prototype code element that was simple and then extended that as the logic became more complex.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

    The big-O analysis really made me think about performance and how to approach algorithmic design. It also showed me that I 
    do not think recursively and that is a weakness in some of my potential designs.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

     I think all of these elements come from practice. I have written enough file streams that I now have a common function 
     that I use as a prototype. I might even take a few of some other elements I keep reusing and develop them in to libraries.
